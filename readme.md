# Syndiv

Syndiv is a simple polynomial division program that uses synthetic division to solve the problem.

Created by Elijah Wilson. 2013.

## To Run:

* Compile syndiv.cxx (you can use the option '-o <filename>' when you compile to make the executable a certain name if you want)
* Run whatever you called the executable (./<filename>) by default it is "a.out" so you would type "./a.out"

And you're done!
